# Important Notice

This repository was created for the sole purpose of doing a project in the online curse from Udacity "Data Analyst". This means, it is not intended for a continue development and will probably not be updated after today (21.07.2020)

## Content

This project analyses a data set of wine quality rating. The data analysis process
includes data wrangling, exploration, drawing conclusions and communicating these using
matplotlib and seaborn. It is pretty much a collection of basic commands that can help any beginner with the data analysis process. If you are starting with this please feel free to get a copy of it. *I tried to be very clear with each step*

## Data set
you can find further information of the data set (as well as the link for the download) in the Jupyter notebook or python script
